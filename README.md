# Marketing Reading Between the Lines

Please note that the code is not in a usable state at this time!!!

This project is initially a PoC but the intent is to continue to grow it into a marketer facing natural language listening service.

The [Wiki](https://github.com/chriseebee/mktgbtwlines/wiki) will be the main content repository for this project, but this README will contain deployment related documentation only.
